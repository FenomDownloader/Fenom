    <h2>How Our Local VPN Tunnel Works</h2>
    </p>

    <p>
        When you enable the Local VPN tunnel feature in [Your App Name], your device's DNS resolution requests are
        routed through
        Cloudflare's DNS server (1.1.1.1) instead of your default DNS resolver provided by your Internet Service
        Provider (ISP). This feature serves the following purposes:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>Overcoming Accessibility Issues</h2>: Some websites may be blocked or restricted by certain ISPs or
            government authorities. The DNS change feature enables users to bypass such restrictions and access these
            websites by using Cloudflare's DNS resolver.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Improved Performance</h2>: By using Cloudflare's DNS server (1.1.1.1), users can experience faster and
            more efficient DNS resolution, leading to quicker website loading times.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Enhanced Privacy and Security</h2>: Cloudflare's DNS service is known for its privacy-centric approach
            and commitment to not log user data. You can learn more about Cloudflare's DNS privacy practices by visiting
            their privacy policy <a
                href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver/">here</a>. By using this
            service, users can enjoy enhanced privacy and security as their DNS queries are not logged or stored.
        </li>
    </ol>




    <br>
    <p>
    <h2>Functionality:</h2>
    </p>



    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>Overcoming Accessibility Issues:</h2> Some websites might be blocked or restricted by
            certain ISPs or government authorities. The DNS change feature enables users to bypass such restrictions and
            access
            these websites by using a different DNS resolver.
        </li>



        <li>
            <h2>Improved Performance:</h2> The feature also aims to improve the performance and speed of DNS
            resolution. By utilizing CloudFlare's DNS server with the IP address 1.1.1.1, users can experience
            faster
            and more efficient DNS resolution, leading to quicker website loading times.
        </li>



        <li>
            <h2>Enhanced Privacy and Security:</h2> CloudFlare's DNS service is known for its
            privacy-centric
            approach and commitment to not log user data. By using this service, users can enjoy enhanced privacy
            and
            security while browsing, as their DNS queries are not logged or stored.
        </li>
    </ol>



    <p>
    <h2>Data Handling:</h2> It's important to note that while using this feature, the Fenom app does not
    collect, process, or store any data related to users' DNS queries, IP addresses, or browsing activities. We
    are
    committed to ensuring the privacy and security of our users, and as such, no data is retained or shared with
